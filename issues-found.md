# Issues Found in Portfolio Images

## Problem
The generated images themselves contain tribal/cultural references that were embedded during image generation:
- "AKAN" branding on stationery
- "Accra Sans" and "Ashanti Serif" in brand guidelines book
- "AHA: KENTE SOUL COLLECTION" on campaign poster
- "AKWAABA LUXURY" on billboard

## Solution
These are baked into the AI-generated images. The only way to fix this is to:
1. Generate NEW images without these cultural references
2. Use different placeholder images that don't have text

The project titles have been updated to generic names like "Luxury Hospitality Brand", "Corporate Stationery Set", etc. but the underlying images still show the problematic text.
